\chapter{Experiment Result and Discussion}

This chapter provides the result and the analysis of the experiment. three hypothesis are analyzed;
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Do participant experience the failure of prospective memory while using the smartphone?}
  \item{Is failure of prospective memory is more likely to happen with two intentions rather than one; intentional load matters}
  \item{Do increasing number of notification influence prospective memory error?}
  \item{Does mentally moving through event boundary increase the likeliness to experience failure of prospective memory?}
\end{itemize}

\section{Prospective memory error on smartphone}

\subsection{Experiment result}
In this expriment the data from the participants from the three studies is combined.
Table \ref{fig:affirmationTable} shows who many participants believe that they have experienced prospective memory error,
and how many participants actually experience the prospective memory error during the experiment.
The participant was asked if they believe that they had experience prospective memory error using the first question on Table \ref{tab:demographicQuestion}.
Actual experience of memory error was calculated by looking if the people forget the questions during the experiment.

%The prospective memory error on the experiment is presented by the lost of intention during the study.
% The first column shows the affirmation on the prospective memory. the number is obtained by asking the participants \textit{"Often people go into a room to do something.  Though they know they intended to do something, they lose track of what they wanted to do.
% This same sort of thing can happen when using a smart phone, as well.  During the study,
% you may have clicked on a link, gone to the website, and then forgot what you intended to look up.  Did that happen to you at all during this study?"} on the post question phase during the experiment.
% While the second column is obtained by counting how many participant forget the question and chosed to look at the question again (lookback) during an experiment.
% The last column shows the total number of the participant participated on each study.
 %or forget the question during the experiment.

\subsection{Discussion}
% As seen in figure \ref{fig:demo1Study1}, \ref{fig:realdemo1Study1}, \ref{fig:demo1Study2}, \ref{fig:realdemo1Study2}, \ref{fig:demo1Study3}, \ref{fig:realdemo1Study3}, the left
% pie chart shows percentage of participant who think they are experiencing prospective memory error, and on the right side shows the percentage of participant who experience
% the prospective memory failure during the experiment.

Most of the participant did not believe that they have experienced the prospective memory error
. In contrast, the output shows that  almost 70\% of the participant actually experienced the prospective memory error.
We can argue that the participant made an intention for looking the answer before clicking the answer link, but after reading the answer page
they lost their original intention.
As a result, they forget the content of the question, and they experience prospective memory error.
This shows that while using a smartphone a person has a high probability of experiencing prospective memory error.
This experiment supports the result of Prof. Richard Alan Carlson's experiment.

\section{The effect of multiple intention}

\subsection{Experiment result}
This section shows the result from the second study. On the second study, one or two questions are presented to the participant randomly.
Table \ref{fig:oneTwoQuestionForget} shows the total number of times the participant forget the question and decide to see it again (lookback).
Each row shows how many times they do a loopback, percentage of loopback (p) and the total of the question.
Because on a second study the number of presented question each time is totally random, so the number of times the participant presented with
one or two question are not similar.
The table shows nine people forget the question, six of them forget the question frequently if two questions are presented.
The last row shows that they forget 31\% of the time if presented with two question.
While they forget only 8\% of the time if they presented with only one question.

Figure \ref{fig:TTFA_oneTwoQues} shows how long in millisecond each participants spent to write the answer (TTLFA).
The horizontal axis is the 11 participants and the vertical axis shows the duration of writing.
 It shows that 63\% (7 out of 11) have longer time writing the answer if two questions are presented each time.

Figure \ref{fig:TTLFA_oneTwoQuesGeneral} shows the general mean of the writing time between one or two qestion from all the participant.
It shows that if two questions are presented then it will take longer time for the people to write the answer.

Figure \ref{fig:lookingAnswer_oneOrTwo} shows the mean each participant spent on finding the answer in the answer page.
 The top plot was calculated on the first time they see the answer page.
 While the lower plot was calculated the second time they see the answer page, after they decide to see the question again (loopback).
Surprisingly the top plot shows that almost half of the participants (4 out of 11) spent significantly longer time for one questions.
However. the lower plot shows that most of the participant spent longer time for two question.

\subsection{Discussion}

In this experiment, the intention of the participant is to find the answer and to write it
thus the number of questions presented is the number of intention need to be retained by the participant.
If the participant forget the question, we can argue that they experience loss of intention Thus they experience
prospective memory error \citep{Reason1984}.

Using this result we are trying to see  if an increasing the number of intention will make people more likely to experience failure of prospective memory
(is the intentional loads matter ?).
Based on the table \ref{fig:oneTwoQuestionForget}, a person is more probable to experience prospective memory error if the amount of the intention is higher.
The result of this study shows that the amount of intentional loads are important component of prospective memory.

Furthermore, the result in figure \ref{fig:TTFA_oneTwoQues} and figure \ref{fig:TTLFA_oneTwoQuesGeneral} shows that the increasing amount intentional loads also
make the person harder to recall the content of the intention. the recall time is presented as the time participant write the answer.
On this analysis the intention is to answer the question and it's formed after the participant found the answer.

In addition, based on figure \ref{fig:lookingAnswer_oneOrTwo}, the increasing amount of intention also increase the time
the participant spent on looking for the answer. This result shows that the number of intention decrease their cognitive performance.
This is probably because the increase of intentions will reduce the level of attention while doing the task, and make
the participant take a longer time to find the answer.

\subsection{The effect of notifiaction}
\subsection{Experiment Result}
Table \ref{tab:notifiactionNumber} shows the mean time participant spent on writing the answer (TTLFA), mean time finding the answer
and the percentage of looking the question again (lookback) group by the number of notification received for each.
It shows that increase in the number of notification make people spent more time writing and finding the answer.
However, the number of notification has no correlation with the percentage of lookback.

\end{tabu}
\caption{The result of different number of notification received by the participant from all studies}
\label{tab:notifiactionNumber}
\end{table}


\subsection{Disscussion}
This result shows that the notification influence the intention, but it doesn't influence the prospective memory error.
Table \ref{tab:notifiactionNumber} shows that the increasing number of notification make people harder to recall the content of the memory.

If the notification is shown when the participant presented with the question,
 then the notification probably lower the level of attention thus make the intention not framed perfectly.
But if the notification is shown when the participant find the answer, this can mean that the notification attenuate the content of intention,
even though it's correctly framed before.

In addition, if we consider the notification as an event boundary. We can argue that
that mentally moving through event boundary will influence the intention but has no effect on the prospective memory error.

\subsection{Event boundary on prospective memory}
\subsection{Experiment Result}
The bar chart \ref{fig:lookingAnswer_lookback} shows the mean time (in millisecond) the participants spent finding the answer on the answer page.
The chart shows the participant who forgets the question (lookback) had spent more time finding the answer before decides to see the question again.
The bar chart \ref{fig:freq_study1} and \ref{fig:freq_study3} shows how many time the participant saw question again (lookback) on each question, it shows the data from first and the third study respectively.
the bar charts show that the more participants forget the question on the third study.
Table \ref{visitedPage} shows the number of web page participant visit by click link inside the web page, and the number of times participant forget the question (lookback).
for the visited link that has zero value, this is probably because the participant did not click the answer links or the application fails to track the data.
% The bar chart \ref{fig:aveTime_study1} and \ref{fig:aveTime_study3} shows the time spent looking for the answer on each questions, it shows the data from first and the third study respectively.
% It shows that the participant spent longer time to look at the answer and they spent longer time to look at the answer again after the do lookback.

\subsection{Discussion}
A participant experience a transition through event boundary after they move from one view to another view on the smartphone.
In this discussion the transition happened two times; when the participant see the question then click the button then the application change to answer link view,
and when the person clicks the answer link then the application change to the answer page view.
During this transition, the participant still retains the intention which is looking for the answer.

The result of the bar chart \ref{fig:lookingAnswer_lookback}  shows that the paricipants who experience prospective memory error had spent more time finding the answer.
We can argue that when they are reading the answer page, they forget the intention (lost intention) or forget the content of the intention (detached intention) which result in prospective memory error.
This happened probably because the amount of new information they received during reading reduce the retention level of the intention \citep{Reason1984}.
We can also argue that a new information probably will mentally create a new event boundary. So the longer time they spent reading the web page, more mental transition happened.
This moving through more event boundary make a person more likely experience prospective memory error.

However, if we consider moving through a new web page is transition between event boundary. Table \ref{visitedPage} shows that there is no relation between mentally transition to prospective memory error.
But this view is very weak since most of the participant only visit the one web page.

To understand the effect of physical transition through event boundary we try to investigate the frequency of prospective memory error between first on the third study.
Bar chart \ref{fig:freq_study1} and \ref{fig:freq_study3} shows that the participant on the third study forgets the question more frequently than the first study. However,
we can only see the probability that physical transition will increase the probability of prospective memory failure, but
we cannot draw a strong correlation because the sample is very small.
This possibility contradict the result from Prof. Richard Alan Carlson experiment.
Over all, the results on this discussion section support the event horizon model proposed by \cite{Radvansky2006}.
% However, by looking at bar charts \ref{fig:aveTime_study1} and \ref{fig:aveTime_study3} we can see that the physical transtition r
% esult on the longer time for people to read and find the answer.
% This shows that the physical transition decrease the capability of cognitive ability while doing this experiment.
