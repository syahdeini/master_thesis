\abstract{%

Prospective memory is remembering to carry out planned action in the future wihtout
instructed to do so.
The prospective memory failure is the common phenomena in everyday life.
The effect of prospective memory failure can be trivial but can also be critical. The topic and the experiment
of this research is based on the experiment conducted by Carlson and his team.
Different component of prospective memory and what aspect influence people to experience the failure was investigated.

An application to conduct a prospective memory experiment is developed.
The application is made flexible so different type of experiment properties can be implemented in the experiment.
The experiment on the failure of prospective memory is also conducted. Data were derived from 18 participants who underwent 3 experimental studies.
The experiment shows that the prospective memory error happens when people use a smartphone.
The amount of intentions is a crucial component of prospective memory
and the mental and physical transition influence of prospective memory error.
